# mars-voice-portal
Voice / (maybe) Video installation for Mars TV portal @brahman.ai!

## TODO

* Figure out what to do with safari/ios
** StereoAudioRecorder might work out the fastest so maybe no video?
** Should take a little bit of testing...

#### Screen page

//* Receive recorded video
* Play recorded video

#### Phone Page

//* Record video + sound on touch/click hold & display.
* global server! One Video Manager (on glitch.. no local perhaps)
* Send recorded video to screen
