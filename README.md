## Dev Instructions
To get auto updates for all changes:

Start all 3 scripts defined in 'package.json' in seperate terminal windows.

## TODO

* Figure out what to do with safari/ios
** StereoAudioRecorder might work out the fastest so maybe no video?
** Should take a little bit of testing...

#### Server

** Locate screen position / layout array
* Timer for sequence
* Send play signal to screens

#### Screen page

* Play on command

#### Phone Page

* Add screen select? (based on ID easiest I guess)
